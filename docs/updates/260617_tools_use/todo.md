# 260617 Tools Use TODO

## Goal

Add a Pixiu-managed external tool environment so CLI agents can reliably use optional tools such as Agent Reach without polluting the system Python or relying on fragile `conda activate` prompt instructions.

The desired behavior:

- Pixiu can create and reuse an isolated managed environment, for example `pixiu-tools`.
- Shell commands run by Pixiu can see managed tool binaries through PATH automatically.
- Missing optional tools such as `agent-reach` can be installed into the managed environment when policy allows it.
- Account authorization steps such as login, QR scan, captcha, Cookie import, browser extension approval, and API token entry still require user collaboration through `request_user_action`.
- Pixiu does not silently install login-heavy/browser-heavy platform channels unless the user has approved that capability.

## Problem

Today, cloning a tool repository does not make its CLI available:

```text
/home/gujing/code/Agent-Reach exists
command -v agent-reach fails
python3 -m pip show agent-reach fails
```

The model can be told in prompt text to activate a conda environment, but this is not robust:

- Every shell call may be a fresh shell.
- `conda activate pixiu` may not persist across commands.
- The model may forget to activate the environment.
- Failed activation can lead the model to try system Python, global `pip`, or ad hoc scripts.
- Generic "install what you need" behavior can conflict with Skill boundaries and account authorization requirements.

## Design Principles

### 1. Runtime PATH Beats Prompt Memory

Prefer configuring Pixiu's shell execution environment over asking the model to remember activation commands.

Instead of relying on:

```bash
conda activate pixiu-tools
agent-reach doctor --json
```

Pixiu should make the managed environment visible to every shell call:

```text
PATH=/home/gujing/miniconda3/envs/pixiu-tools/bin:$PATH
```

Then the agent can simply run:

```bash
agent-reach doctor --json
```

### 2. Isolate Tool Dependencies

External CLI dependencies should live in a Pixiu-managed environment, not system Python.

Suggested default:

```text
environment name: pixiu-tools
python: 3.12
scope: user/local
purpose: optional external CLIs and research tools
```

This environment can contain:

- `agent-reach`
- `mcporter`
- `yt-dlp`
- `browser-use`
- platform CLIs selected by Agent Reach
- other future optional Pixiu tool dependencies

### 3. Dependency Install Is Different From Account Authorization

Pixiu may be allowed to install packages into the managed environment.

Pixiu must not silently complete user-account actions:

- login
- QR scan
- captcha
- 2FA
- Cookie/session import
- browser extension authorization
- API key/token entry
- account permission changes

Those must use `request_user_action`.

### 4. Skills Can Request Tools, Runtime Enforces Boundaries

Skills such as `agent-reach` should say what tools and credentials they need, but Pixiu runtime should provide the stable tool environment and enforce stop points.

Prompt guidance alone is not enough.

## Proposed Config

Add a config section for managed tools:

```jsonc
{
  "tools": {
    "managedEnv": {
      "enabled": true,
      "manager": "conda",
      "name": "pixiu-tools",
      "python": "3.12",
      "autoCreate": true,
      "prependPath": true,
      "autoInstall": "ask"
    }
  }
}
```

Possible `autoInstall` values:

```text
off   - never install tools automatically
ask   - ask before installing missing tools
allow - install into managed env without extra confirmation when the Skill/policy permits it
```

Keep the default conservative:

```text
autoCreate: true
autoInstall: ask
```

## Proposed CLI

Add or consider these commands:

```bash
pixiu tools env status
pixiu tools env create
pixiu tools env path
pixiu tools install agent-reach
pixiu tools doctor
```

Expected output for status:

```text
Managed tool environment
manager: conda
name: pixiu-tools
python: 3.12
path: /home/gujing/miniconda3/envs/pixiu-tools
bin: /home/gujing/miniconda3/envs/pixiu-tools/bin
PATH active: yes

Installed tools
agent-reach: missing
```

## Agent Reach Flow

When the user asks for a platform-specific task such as XiaoHongShu:

```text
1. Load agent-reach Skill.
2. Run agent-reach doctor --json.
3. If agent-reach exists, use doctor output to select backend.
4. If agent-reach is missing:
   - If managed env is enabled and autoInstall permits installation, install Agent Reach into pixiu-tools.
   - Otherwise call request_user_action or ask for install approval.
5. Rerun agent-reach doctor --json.
6. If the platform needs login/cookie/QR/captcha/browser authorization, call request_user_action.
7. After the user completes authorization, rerun doctor and continue.
```

Suggested install command for local cloned Agent Reach:

```bash
conda run -n pixiu-tools python -m pip install -e /home/gujing/code/Agent-Reach
```

Fallback install if using published package:

```bash
conda run -n pixiu-tools python -m pip install agent-reach
```

## Runtime Guardrail

Add a narrow runtime guard for Skill routes that need managed tools.

Example for `agent-reach`:

```text
skill(agent-reach) loaded
agent-reach doctor --json fails with command not found
```

Then Pixiu should enter a structured blocker state:

```json
{
  "kind": "missing_managed_tool",
  "skill": "agent-reach",
  "tool": "agent-reach",
  "allowedNext": ["request_user_action", "pixiu_managed_tool_install"]
}
```

While this blocker is active, Pixiu should reject unrelated workaround attempts such as:

- private endpoint probing
- platform scraping scripts
- third-party aggregator scraping
- browser automation experiments
- global `pip install --break-system-packages`

The rejection should be model-correctable and user-visible:

```text
Agent Reach is missing. Use request_user_action to ask for installation approval, or install it into the Pixiu managed tool environment.
```

## Implementation Slices

### Slice 1: Managed Env Discovery

- [x] Detect the configured environment manager.
  - [x] `conda`
  - [x] `mamba` / `micromamba`
  - [x] plain Python `venv` as fallback
- [x] Resolve managed env path and bin path.
- [x] Add config schema for `tools.managedEnv`.
- [x] Add tests for config defaults and invalid values.

### Slice 2: Shell PATH Injection

- [x] Extend shell execution config with managed env PATH prepend.
- [x] Ensure every shell tool call receives the managed env `bin` path when enabled.
- [x] Preserve existing env allowlist and secret redaction behavior.
- [x] Add tests proving shell can find a fake managed-env binary without `conda activate`.

### Slice 3: CLI Tool Env Commands

- [x] Add `pixiu tools env status`.
- [x] Add `pixiu tools env create`.
- [x] Add `pixiu tools env path`.
- [x] Add `pixiu tools doctor`.
- [x] Keep commands non-destructive and explicit.
- [x] Render clear guidance when conda is missing.

### Slice 4: Managed Tool Installer

- [x] Add first known optional tool support.
  - [x] `agent-reach`
- [x] For `agent-reach`, prefer editable install from `/home/gujing/code/Agent-Reach` when that path exists.
- [x] Otherwise install from package source if configured.
- [x] Install only into the managed env.
- [x] Never use system `pip`, `--break-system-packages`, or global package mutation.
- [x] Add tests with fake managed env/tool detection.

### Slice 5: Agent Reach Integration

- [x] Teach the `agent-reach` Skill to mention managed env install as the preferred missing-tool fix.
- [x] If `agent-reach doctor --json` fails with command not found, offer or perform managed-env install based on policy.
- [x] Rerun `agent-reach doctor --json` after successful install.
- [x] Preserve the auth boundary: login/Cookie/QR/captcha still calls `request_user_action`.
- [x] Add scenario tests for:
  - [x] missing Agent Reach + install approved
  - [x] missing Agent Reach + install not approved
  - [x] Agent Reach installed + XiaoHongShu login required

Implementation note: Pixiu now exposes `pixiu tools install agent-reach --yes`, mentions managed tool installs in the default tool-use prompt and Agent Reach Skill, and prepends the managed env bin directory to shell PATH, so a successfully installed Agent Reach CLI is reused in later shell calls. The runner also tracks the Agent Reach Skill route: after `agent-reach` is missing, it blocks unrelated fallback commands, allows explicit managed-env install, and auto-runs the managed installer when `tools.managedEnv.autoInstall` is `allow`.

### Slice 6: Runtime Skill Guardrail

- [x] Track when a Skill route is active in the current run.
- [x] Detect structured blockers from tool results.
  - [x] command not found for required Skill tool
  - [x] login required
  - [x] Cookie/session missing
  - [x] QR/captcha/2FA required
- [x] Restrict next tool calls when a blocker requires user collaboration or managed-env install.
- [x] Return model-correctable tool errors instead of letting the model wander.
- [x] Add tests proving fallback scripts/web probing are rejected while the blocker is active.

### Slice 7: Docs And UX Polish

- [x] Document the difference between cloned source and installed CLI.
- [x] Document managed env setup.
- [x] Document Agent Reach install flow.
- [x] Document which steps Pixiu can automate and which require user action.
- [x] Update CLI help after commands stabilize.

### Slice 8: Tool-Use Semantic Activity Contract Alignment

#### Goal

Improve Pixiu's Activity timeline by aligning the existing implementation around an intent-centric and fact-verified tool activity contract.

Current default traces can still drift toward command-centric entries such as:

```text
Command completed
curl -s "https://wttr.in/Wuhan?format=..."
```

The target default Activity display should be closer to:

```text
✓ Checked Wuhan weather
  Fetched current weather data from wttr.in
```

Raw command/tool details must remain available in Raw Details.

This slice is an alignment and gap-closing slice. Reuse the existing activity model, `_activity` support, shell `purpose`, `metadata.activity`, CLI semantic trace, and Web UI activity timeline. Do not create a parallel Activity type system.

Do not implement project/session lifecycle in this slice.

#### Current Status

Already implemented or partially implemented:

- [x] `_activity` can be attached to tool calls.
- [x] `_activity` is stripped before tool execution.
- [x] Shell accepts optional `purpose`.
- [x] Built-in tools emit `metadata.activity` for many operations.
- [x] CLI trace uses semantic labels for shell purpose and known command fallbacks.
- [x] Web UI has a metadata-first semantic Activity path.
- [x] Run status values are no longer only `busy/idle/error`.

Current run status values:

```ts
queued | running | waiting_for_permission | idle | error | cancelled
```

Do not reintroduce stale run status values such as only `busy/idle/error`.

#### Core Contract

Activity combines two sources:

```text
LLM intent = what the model is trying to do
Tool result = what actually happened
```

The UI must never treat LLM intent as verified fact.

Expected lifecycle:

```text
tool_call:
  create/update ActivityItem from tool_call._activity when present
  status = running
  source = llm_intent

tool_result:
  update the same ActivityItem by toolCallId
  final status comes from execution result
  enrich with metadata.activity when present

fallback:
  if no _activity and no metadata.activity, use deterministic formatter
```

Important rule:

```text
LLM intent may provide the title.
Tool result decides whether the activity succeeded.
```

#### Activity Types

Reuse existing shared activity types. Do not replace them with a new dotted enum model.

Current coarse `kind` values should remain the public stable category:

```ts
tool | file | shell | search | skill | permission | artifact | system | other
```

If finer operation labels are needed, add them as metadata instead of replacing `kind`, for example:

```ts
details: {
  operation: "file.read"
}
```

or, if truly useful:

```ts
subkind?: "file.read" | "shell.command" | "web.fetch" | "skill.load" | "todo.update"
```

Do not duplicate parallel `ActivityItem` or `ActivityMetadata` definitions.

#### Tool Call Intent: `_activity`

Allow the model to attach a Pixiu-only `_activity` object to any tool call.

Example:

```json
{
  "command": "curl -s \"https://wttr.in/Wuhan?format=%C+%t+%w+%h\"",
  "_activity": {
    "kind": "search",
    "title": "Checking Wuhan weather",
    "summary": "Fetching current weather data from wttr.in",
    "target": "Wuhan",
    "details": {
      "operation": "web.fetch"
    }
  }
}
```

Rules:

- [x] `_activity` is optional.
- [x] `_activity` describes intent, not verified success.
- [x] `_activity` is stripped before the real tool handler runs.
- [x] `_activity` does not break strict tool schema validation.
- [x] `_activity` works for shell, read, write, edit, skill, MCP, and future tools.
- [x] No extra LLM call is introduced.
- [x] `_activity` must not include secrets or large raw outputs.

#### Tool Result Metadata: `metadata.activity`

Tool results may include:

```ts
metadata: {
  activity?: ActivityMetadata
}
```

Built-in tools should emit `metadata.activity` where possible.

Recommended mappings using current coarse kinds:

```text
read:
  kind=file
  title=Read file
  target=path
  details.operation=file.read

write:
  kind=file
  title=Wrote file / Updated file
  target=path
  details.operation=file.write

edit / patch:
  kind=file
  title=Updated file
  target=path
  details.operation=file.edit

shell:
  kind=shell
  title=Command completed / Command failed, or semantic purpose
  command=command
  status=success/error
  details.operation=shell.command

skill:
  kind=skill
  title=Loaded skill
  target=skill name
  details.operation=skill.load

todowrite:
  kind=system
  title=Updated todos
  details.operation=todo.update

artifact-producing tools:
  kind=artifact
  title=Created artifact
  target=artifact path
  details.operation=artifact.create
```

Do not remove existing metadata fields.
Do not remove raw result content.

#### Runner And Trace Requirements

- [x] On `tool_call`, extract `_activity` and create a running ActivityItem when present.
- [x] Strip `_activity` before validation/execution and before persisted tool messages where appropriate.
- [x] Keep raw tool call input available in Raw Details.
- [x] On `tool_result`, find the existing ActivityItem by `toolCallId`.
- [x] Update the same item instead of creating a duplicate.
- [x] If no existing item exists, create one from `metadata.activity`.
- [x] If neither intent nor metadata exists, use deterministic fallback.
- [x] Final status comes from execution result:
  - [x] success -> `success`
  - [x] failure/error -> `error`
  - [x] permission denied or skipped -> `skipped`
  - [x] cancellation -> `cancelled`
- [x] `metadata.activity` may enrich summary, target, command, and details.
- [x] Do not blindly overwrite a better intent title with a generic result title.
- [x] Set `startedAt` and `endedAt` where the runtime has reliable timestamps.

#### Shell `purpose` Compatibility

Keep `purpose?: string` for shell as compatibility, but prefer generic `_activity` when available.

Priority:

```text
1. tool_call._activity
2. shell purpose
3. tool_result.metadata.activity
4. deterministic fallback
5. generic command label
```

If only `purpose` exists:

```json
{
  "command": "npm run typecheck",
  "purpose": "Run TypeScript type check"
}
```

Activity may show:

```text
✓ Run TypeScript type check
  npm run typecheck
```

Raw command must remain visible in details.

#### UI Priority Order

Default Activity should derive entries using this order:

```text
1. tool_call._activity updated by tool_result
2. tool_result.metadata.activity
3. tool_call.input.purpose or concise semantic input
4. deterministic frontend/backend heuristic
5. generic fallback
```

Bad default display:

```text
Command completed
curl -s "https://wttr.in/Wuhan?format=..."
```

Good default display:

```text
✓ Checked Wuhan weather
  Fetched current weather data from wttr.in
```

Raw command remains available under Raw Details.

#### Prompt / Tool-Use Instruction

Keep a short default instruction:

```text
When calling a tool, you may include a Pixiu-only `_activity` object to describe the user-visible intent of this tool call. Keep it concise, factual, and free of sensitive data. `_activity.title` should describe what you are trying to do, not just the raw command. Pixiu will strip `_activity` before executing the tool.
```

Example shell call:

```json
{
  "command": "npm run typecheck",
  "_activity": {
    "kind": "shell",
    "title": "Running TypeScript type check",
    "summary": "Checking the project for TypeScript errors",
    "details": {
      "operation": "shell.command"
    }
  }
}
```

Example read call:

```json
{
  "path": "src/agent/runner.ts",
  "_activity": {
    "kind": "file",
    "title": "Reading agent runner implementation",
    "summary": "Inspecting how Pixiu handles tool events",
    "details": {
      "operation": "file.read"
    }
  }
}
```

Do not require `_activity` on every tool call.

#### Frontend Trace Requirements

- [x] Live SSE `tool_call` preserves `_activity` in trace/raw details.
- [x] Live SSE `tool_result` preserves `metadata.activity`.
- [x] Restored session trace recovers activity metadata from persisted messages/events.
- [x] Missing metadata falls back to existing heuristics.
- [x] Raw Details remains expandable.
- [x] Old sessions still render.
- [x] Web UI and CLI should share the same semantic formatter where practical.

#### Noise Control

Do not put run lifecycle entries into semantic Activity:

```text
queued
running
idle
ready
done
```

Those belong to RunStatus.

`Run completed` may remain in Raw Trace, but should not dominate the default semantic Activity list.

Avoid duplicate items:

```text
running intent item
success result item
```

should become one updated item, not two separate cards.

#### Tests

Tool tests:

- [x] `read` returns `metadata.activity.kind=file`.
- [x] `write` returns `metadata.activity.kind=file`.
- [x] `edit` / `patch` return `metadata.activity.kind=file`.
- [x] `shell` returns `metadata.activity.kind=shell`.
- [x] `shell` success maps to `success`.
- [x] `shell` failure maps to `error`.
- [x] `shell` supports legacy `purpose`.
- [x] `todowrite` returns `metadata.activity.kind=system`.
- [x] `skill` returns `metadata.activity.kind=skill`.

Runner tests:

- [x] Tool call with `_activity` creates a running ActivityItem.
- [x] `_activity` is stripped before actual tool handler execution.
- [x] Strict schema tools do not fail because of `_activity`.
- [x] Tool result success updates the same item to success.
- [x] Tool result error updates the same item to error.
- [x] `metadata.activity` enriches existing intent item.
- [x] No `_activity` falls back to `metadata.activity`.
- [x] No metadata falls back to deterministic formatter.
- [x] No duplicate ActivityItem for the same `toolCallId`.

UI tests:

- [x] ActivityPanel prefers intent-based activity over raw command.
- [x] ActivityPanel uses `metadata.activity` before heuristic.
- [x] Raw command remains visible in Raw Details.
- [x] Restored session preserves activity metadata.
- [x] Old sessions without metadata still render timeline.
- [x] RunStatus is not polluted by activity.
- [x] TodoProgress is not polluted by activity.

#### Manual Verification

Use this flow:

```text
User: 武汉明天天气？
```

Expected default Activity:

```text
✓ Checked Wuhan weather
  Fetched current weather data from wttr.in
```

Not preferred:

```text
Command completed
curl -s "https://wttr.in/Wuhan?format=..."
```

If the command fails:

```text
✕ Failed to check Wuhan weather
  Weather fetch command failed
```

Raw curl command must still be visible in Raw Details.

#### Final Report Required

After implementation, report:

1. Modified files.
2. New or reused activity types.
3. How `_activity` enters tool calls.
4. How `_activity` is stripped before execution.
5. How tool_call creates running ActivityItem.
6. How tool_result updates the same ActivityItem.
7. Built-in tools that emit `metadata.activity`.
8. Fallback priority order.
9. CLI and Web UI display behavior.
10. Raw Details preservation.
11. Tests run and results.
12. Known limitations.

### Slice 9: Optional Browser-Use Skill Backend

#### Goal

Evaluate and integrate `browser-use` as an optional browser automation backend for Pixiu, without making it a Pixiu core dependency.

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/browser-use/browser-use
```

Browser-use should be treated as a managed external tool plus Skill backend. It can help when a task needs a real browser interaction layer, but it must not be treated as a way to bypass platform authentication, CAPTCHA, 2FA, QR scan, account consent, or anti-abuse controls.

#### Positioning

Use `browser-use` for:

- JS-rendered pages where `web_fetch` is insufficient.
- User-approved browser interactions such as opening a page, clicking visible controls, typing text, taking screenshots, and reading visible state.
- Workflows where a browser profile or local desktop/browser environment is explicitly available.
- Agent Reach fallback/backends that need a browser interaction layer and still respect user-action blockers.

Do not use `browser-use` for:

- bypassing login, QR scan, CAPTCHA, 2FA, Cookie/session requirements, or browser extension approval.
- scraping private platform endpoints after a Skill route has hit an auth blocker.
- silently using Browser Use Cloud, proxy, or stealth services without explicit user configuration and approval.
- replacing Agent Reach for platform-specific routing.
- becoming a required Pixiu dependency.

#### Proposed Install Flow

Add managed tool support:

```bash
pixiu tools install browser-use
pixiu tools doctor
```

Install only into the managed tool environment, for example:

```bash
conda run -n pixiu-tools python -m pip install "browser-use[core]"
```

If browser binaries or extra dependencies are needed, they should be installed through an explicit managed-tool command or user-approved setup step. Do not mutate system Python or global browser state.

#### Proposed Skill

Add a local `browser-use` Skill with rules:

- Use only when the user asks for browser interaction or when ordinary web tools cannot inspect the needed page.
- Prefer low-level observable actions over delegating to a second autonomous browser agent.
- Use concise semantic tool activity for browser actions.
- Preserve screenshots, URLs, and visible-state evidence when useful.
- Call `request_user_action` for login, QR scan, CAPTCHA, 2FA, Cookie/session import, browser profile selection, browser extension approval, or cloud/proxy credentials.

Initial Skill examples:

```text
open page
inspect visible state
click visible element
type text
take screenshot
close browser
```

Avoid starting with an opaque "agent inside agent" API. Pixiu should stay in control of the step loop, permissions, trace, activity metadata, and blockers.

#### Runtime Guardrail Follow-Up

Generalize the current Agent Reach route blocker into a reusable Skill route policy:

```ts
type SkillRouteBlocker =
  | missing_managed_tool
  | user_action_required
  | browser_environment_required
```

Then `agent-reach`, `browser-use`, and future browser/platform Skills can share the same behavior:

- missing tool -> managed env install or user approval
- login / QR / CAPTCHA / 2FA / Cookie -> `request_user_action`
- no ad hoc scraping or private endpoint fallback while blocked
- explicit user choice required before switching to third-party aggregate data

#### Browser Environment Notes

Browser-use may still fail in server environments without GUI/browser support. Future implementation should detect and explain:

- no display / X server unavailable
- browser binary missing
- browser profile unavailable
- browser dependency download blocked
- cloud API key missing when cloud mode is requested

These should become structured blockers rather than long exploratory command loops.

#### Tests To Add Later

- `pixiu tools install browser-use` preview and `--yes` paths.
- Managed env detection for `browser-use`.
- Browser-use Skill loading and prompt rules.
- Missing browser-use command creates a managed-tool blocker.
- Login/QR/CAPTCHA output creates a user-action blocker.
- Browser environment missing creates `browser_environment_required`.
- Agent does not switch to scraping/private endpoints while browser route is blocked.

#### Manual Verification Later

Use a harmless public page first:

```text
Open example.com, read the visible heading, take a screenshot.
```

Then test an auth boundary:

```text
Open a site that requires login.
Expected: Pixiu asks for user action instead of attempting to bypass login.
```

## Non-goals

- Do not make Agent Reach a required Pixiu dependency.
- Do not vendor Agent Reach Python code into Pixiu.
- Do not silently install every Agent Reach optional channel.
- Do not automate platform login, QR scan, captcha, 2FA, or Cookie extraction without user action.
- Do not use system Python or global `pip` for managed tools.
- Do not rely on `conda activate` persisting across independent shell calls.
- Do not bypass platform authentication with scraping workarounds.
- Do not implement project/session lifecycle as part of Slice 8.
- Do not add extra LLM summarization calls for Activity.
- Do not remove Raw Trace or Raw Details.

## Verification

Core checks:

```bash
PATH=.tools/bun/bin:$PATH bun run typecheck
PATH=.tools/bun/bin:$PATH bun test
git diff --check
```

Manual checks:

```bash
pixiu tools env status
pixiu tools env create
pixiu tools install agent-reach
pixiu tools doctor
agent-reach doctor --json
```

Agent behavior checks:

```text
User: 帮我看看小红书热门话题
Expected:
- load agent-reach Skill
- check doctor
- install Agent Reach into managed env if allowed
- request user action when XiaoHongShu login state is missing
- no ad hoc scraping/private endpoint fallback unless user explicitly chooses it
```
